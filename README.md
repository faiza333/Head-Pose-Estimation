## AFLW2000 it containes around 2000 photo

# Project Idea

## In the project we get the headpose from '2d' landmarks not 3d landmarks.. To do so with the classical way they have to fit the 2d points ## with a 3d face model which is considered as a fitting technique. At the end, it is not a deterministic solution and has its problems. 
## Here comes the ML to replace the 3d fitting assumption, the camera parameters and the projection equations



# Result on image
